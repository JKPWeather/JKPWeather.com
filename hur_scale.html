            About my new hurricane scale:
        </h2>
        <h4>
            A more extensive piece of writing on it may come soon.
        </h4>
        <p>
            I made a scale for measuring hurricanes 
            that takes into account the proportion of 
            deaths that occur from each threat 
            (wind, rain, surge). You can see in the top
            right of the spreadsheet the percentage of
            deaths that each one causes and then
            that extrapolated to add to 100%. I used
            the Saffir-Simpson scale for wind and then just 
            arbitrary marks for the others. I kept the 6 
            categories (TS-5). To get a wind "score"
            to add to the overall score which I used to
            get the categories, I multiplied the wind
            speeds by the percent of deaths they 
            cause. To get a rain "score" I divided the 
            Category 2 median wind (S-S scale; 103 mph)
            by the Category 2 equivalent rain (14.5 inches) to 
            make them of equal scales. In order to
            compare my scale to the current
            scale, I created a product similar
            to the "practically perfect" product
            for severe weather. It takes into 
            account damage and deaths
            caused by past storms to figure
            out what category they 'should'
            have been. To sort each into categories 
            (two for each category on the scale; 
            when I only sorted it into one for 
            each it was nearly impossible to get 
            a tropical storm), I just sorted by number 
            and broke it into roughly equal sections. 
            The average of the two numbers 
            (one for deaths, one for damage), 
            divided by two and rounded up, 
            becomes the hindcast for a given storm. 
            Feel free to get in touch if you have 
            any comments, questions, or concerns.

            Here is the scale. The first tab is the methodology, 
            the second is the three versions of the scale 
            tested on every Atlantic basin land-impacting 
            storm since 2012 and compared to the current scale, 
            the third tab is the hindcast for deaths, and the 
            fourth tab is the hindcast for damage.
